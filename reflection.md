- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why? For this assignment, I decided to overload the constructors in House and Cafe and also overload the sellCoffee() method in Cafe. I added an extra House constructor so I could create a house without providing an elevator value. I also overloaded sellCoffee() so that I could sell a basic coffee with just a size instead of giving sugar and cream values.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? What worked well was adding the new methods and reusing code with super(). Using the new enter(), exit(), and goToFloor() methods from Building was also very helpful. The hardest part was remembering to match parameters when adding overloaded methods. Once I tested my code step by step, it worked.

My advice for future students is to test each class as you build it. Itâ€™s also helpful to print out messages so you can easily see what your program is doing. Overloading makes the program easier to use once you understand it.
